Your goal is to identify the correct note by clicking the corresponding piano key. Each correct answer earns you points and builds your streak!</p><p>Look at the note displayed on the staff (the lines and spaces where music is written). Then, find and click the matching white key on the piano keyboard below. If you're correct, you'll hear the note play and your streak will increase. If you're incorrect, you'll hear a "thud" sound, and your streak will reset.</p></div></div></section><section class="tutorial-section"><h2><i class="fas fa-level-up-alt"></i> Levels and Progression</h2><div class="tutorial-item"><div class="tutorial-description"><h3>Progressive Difficulty</h3><p>The game features multiple levels with increasing difficulty. New notes are introduced gradually as you master the current ones. To advance to the next level, you need to achieve a specific streak and speed requirement.</p><p>Each level focuses on a small set of notes. As you consistently identify them correctly and quickly, you'll unlock the next level, which introduces more notes. The required streak (number of correct answers in a row) and speed (average time per note) for advancing are shown in the top-right corner of the game screen.</p></div></div></section><section class="tutorial-section"><h2><i class="fas fa-user"></i> User Profiles</h2><div class="tutorial-item"><div class="tutorial-description"><h3>Multiple Profiles</h3><p>Create different profiles for multiple users.

Here you can adjust various options:</p><ul><li><strong>Show Note Names:</strong> Toggle this to display the letter names (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) directly on the piano keys. This can be helpful when you are first learning the keyboard layout.</li><li><strong>Show All Notes:</strong> By default, only the notes relevant to the current level are shown as active options. Toggle this setting to see all possible notes highlighted on the keyboard, even those not currently being tested. This can help understand the context of the notes within the full piano range.</li><li><strong>Reset Progress:</strong> If you want to start over for the currently selected profile, click this button. It will reset the unlocked levels and learned notes for that profile only.</li><li><strong>Clear All Profiles:</strong> This button completely wipes all saved data, including all user profiles and their progress. Use with caution, as this action cannot be undone!</li><li><strong>Level Selection:</strong> You can manually select any level you have previously unlocked for the current profile.
